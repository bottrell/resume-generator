# Resume Generator by Bottrell
Welcome to my very first site created in React! 
I've dabbled in web dev for a while, mainly in the .NET space, but JavaScript has always been kind of scary to me, so I've avoided the popular JavaScript libraries until this year.
This project is my first attempt at playing around with React, and seeing if I can build something tangible.

The goal of the project is to programmatically generate Resume's using React's built-in state management feature to pass data between the Application pane and the resume pane. The final product will include the ability to switch resume templates as well as download the resume as a PDF. 

These are stretch goals for me as I continue to learn React, so I fully expect the App to be re-architected several times. 

To run the app, simply call `npm start` via the command line in the project folder, and watch your resume come to life!
